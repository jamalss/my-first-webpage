# _My First Web Page with Epicodus_

#### _This web page is my first sample web page created as part of the lessons on Epicodus, {March 10, 2017}_

#### By _**Jamal Samuel**_

## Description

_As stated above this web page is my first sample written with Epicodus. It gives some basic information as to what I am going to learn about coding with the time I spend here at Epicodus and can be used as a point of my learning path's reference. There are also links to a my-favourite-things webpage I created and Epicodus' website. The my-favourite-things web page also was a project I did on Epicodus. Enjoy!_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

###To add this file to your personal computer

* _Open you Git Terminal._
* _Go to your Desktop folder (or any other folder you may choose; take not that it is important not to clone one project into another projectâ€™s folder) by using the cd Desktop command in the Terminal._
* _Get a copy of the link on github.com or copy it here- https://github.com/jamalss/my-first-webpage_
* _In the Terminal window type in git clone plus the web address like this- git clone https://github.com/jamalss/my-first-webpage_ This clones the my-first-webpage folder to your computer's Desktop or whatever folder you chose
* _Type ls in the Terminal and you should see your project folder appear._
* _Go into that project folder in the Terminal._
* _Type git log to confirm that you are in the project folder and can see all of your git commits from your previous work on this project. (If this list of commits is long, you may have to press q to get back to the command line prompt.)_
* _Type git remote -v and you should see a remote link nicknamed origin to your remote repository url. (Whenever we clone a project from GitHub the repository we cloned from is automatically included as a remote named origin)._
